    "Below is a damn simple programm that demonstrates a simple multrithreading app. Lets assume we have some simple task (def doTask()) and we have to launch it N times in a row (amountOftasks). In this task we have random time insleep that represents some work done or waiting a response from somewhere. Lets first launch it in a single thread one by one and then launch them via multithreading lib nad compare time difference!"
